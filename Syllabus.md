## Course Description
This is an introductory course on linear algebra.
Linear algebra studies systems of linear equations and properties of vectors and matrices, and is useful in natural science and engineering, economics, social science, and especially in machine learning and optimization.
I will introduce basic concepts and properties in linear algebra and matrix theory,
as well as how to compute matrix algebra by *Python programming*. 
As an application, I will explain how neural network and *natural language processing*(NLP) works via `word2vec` algorithm.

## Course Objectives
This course expects all students to fully understand the material covered in the class. 
At the end of class, successful students will
* understand basic concepts in linear algebra;
* have mathematical proficiency. That is, students are able to write and communicate mathematics in a higher level;
* be able to use Python to compute matrix computation;
* understand the neural network, and be able to construct a mathematical model using it;
* be able to initiate their own researches on NLP.

## Prerequisites and Texts
There is no formal prerequisite for this course.
However, it may help to understand contents covered in *Differential Equations and Applied Calculus*(SE101) and *Multivariable Caclulus*(SE102).
Our official textbook is

## Assessments and Grading
The grades are based on two exams(midterm and final), homeworks, research project on NLP, and class participation. Percentages are the following.
* Midterm (30\%)
* Final (30\%)
* Homeworks (15\%)
* Project (15\%)
* Class participation (10\%)

he table below shows the schematic of the final grade. If the total score is greater than or equal to $90$, then the final grade is $A+$. If the total score is strictly less than $90$ and greater than or equal to $80$, the final grade will be $A0$, and so on.

| Total Score | 90 | 80 | 75 | 65 | 55 | 50 | 40 | 30 | 25 | 15 | 5  | 0  |
| ----------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Grade       | A+ | A0 | A- | B+ | B0 | B- | C+ | C0 | C- | D+ | D0 | D- |


## Exams
There are two exams in this course.
Midterm and final will be on 8th and 16th weeks respectively. 
Exact date,time, and place for exams will be announced 1-2 weeks ahead.
The content of the exam will be different from the other sections of the same course..

The exam evaluate how students understand the materials covered in the class.
Students must write as detail as possible in their solution.
There will be questions on computation, as well as questions on explaining mathematical concepts. 
Every solution must be written in full sentences with valid logic.
There might be a questions which asks students to collaborate with each others during the exam.
In such circumstance, specific instruction will be provided in the exam.

Midterm and Final are the crucial components for the final grade.
*If you do not take midterm or final, you will fail the course*. 
Based on 5-point scoring system, each question will be graded by the following scheme.

* (5 points) The solution is written by complete sentences and delivers correct answer with flawless mathematical ideas. The solution contains detail explanation of the how the answer is obtained.
* (4 points) The solution is written by complete sentences and uses correct ideas and theorems. However, it misses a few detail or makes small mistakes. The solution may contain some flaw or logical gaps, which are not crucial part of the answer.
* (3 points) Student explains their work in detail, but uses a wrong/incorrect idea/theory. Or they come up with partially wrong answer. Otherwise, the conclusion of the solution is correct, but it has no detail explanations.
* (2 points) There is no detail explanation, nor conclusion/answer in the solution. Students vaguely show their ideas, which are not entirely wrong.
* (1 point) The solution contains no complete sentences, or logical explanations. However, it contains a partially correct statement of the theorems relevant to the problem.
* (0 point) Students attempt to use completely wrong idea and false statement. Solution contains no logical statement at all.

## Homework

There will be 9 homeworks throughout the semester.
The homework consists of mathematical proof and computation, as well as Python programming exercises.
The homework should be submitted through [LMS](http://lms.dgist.ac.kr).

You must scan your work in pdf format and upload the pdf file to designated website.
There are many apps for scanning document by your smart phone.
If you have not used such apps, I recommend using: 

* [Adobe Rader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.reader)
* [Adobe Scan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.scan.android)

Due dates are written in the *Class Schedule* below. Deadlines are 23:59 of each due date. (1 minute earlier than the midnight!) Due to the traffic, you must upload your work 
When the homework is submitted late, 50\% of the total points will be deducted per day. (No exception!)
This means that if you late by two days, your homework will not be graded.

\subsection*{Project}

Each student will initiate a project on NLP individually or within a group.
Each group must choose their own subject of the research, which must be original.
Students must use Python. (No other tools are allowed.)

The evaluation is based on presentation.
During the 10-minute presentation, students must explain the research subject, questions and problems, and methods they used for solving the problem.
The following is the grading scheme.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item (Originality) The work must contains an original interpretation / conclusion.
	\item (Effectiveness) The research have an impact to other research area or real life. 
	\item (Mathematics) The plan and methods of research must be logical and based on concrete mathematical theories and models.
	\end{itemize}
%
%Each student must write his/her own final report.
%The class will show no mercy on plagiarism.
%Even though the project is done by a group, each student have different viewpoint on the same subject.
%The final report must contains the original idea and observation on the research subject, as well as detail explanation which could be omitted in the presentation.
%The report must contain clear references on every fact used in the report.
%The following is the grading scheme.
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item (Amount) The report must contain detail of the work, including backgrounds and progress. The report must be the level of students who took the class in linear algebra.
%		\item (Originality) The report must contain author's own idea and interpretation. 
%		\item (Structure) The report must be a scientific writing. Any facts from book or website used in the report must be followed by the reference.
%	\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Class Participation}

The class participation is evaluated by number attendances in class.
Each time a student misses, or late a class, 1\% of the grade will be lowered.
\textbf{If you miss or late to class more than 10 times, you will fail the course.}
For exemption, you must provide an official documents (such as a doctor's note, or an organization's official letter, etc)
